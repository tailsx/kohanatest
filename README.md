# Part 3: Contest Internationalize

This part is not 100% complete.  Only thing not done is translating the url to whatever language it is currently.  I feel like it may be a module problem, but I did spend a decent amount of time trying everything I can think of and there is very little documentation other than the information from flexilang module.  

### Problems/Reflection

*  Thought at first I was not allowed to touch my controllers or views but after re-reading, it just says I can't add more controllers or views to accomdate the other language.  That made things easier.
*  Documentation was easy to follow, even though one part of the translation is not working ideally.
