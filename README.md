# Part 1: Fizz Buzz

My FizzBuzz implementation.  Changed the bootstrap routing to point to the FizzBuzz controller, which calls the fizzbuzz view.

### Problems/Reflection

*  Not knowing any PHP, took my time learning how to use it.
*  Spent a bit too much time trying to find an impressive way to write fizzbuzz but decided to keep it simple.
*  Kohana set up wasn't too bad.  The few youtube videos out there were sufficient.
